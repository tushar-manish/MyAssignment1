    <p>JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that
      conforms to the ECMAScript specification.[7] JavaScript is high-level,
      often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket
      syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and
      first-class functions.Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the
      core technologies of the World Wide Web.[8] JavaScript enables
      interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications.
      The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior,
      and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to
      execute it.</p>
