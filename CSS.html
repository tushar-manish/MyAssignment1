    <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
      describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language
      like HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web,
      alongside HTML and JavaScript.CSS is designed to enable the separation
      of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.
       This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more
       flexibility and control in the specification of presentation
       characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by
       specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce
       complexity and repetition in the structural content.</p>
