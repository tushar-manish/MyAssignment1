    <h2>About Course</h2>
    <p>Full stack in technology development refers to an entire computer
      system or application from front end (customer or user-facing) to
      the back end (the "behind-the-scenes" technology such as databases
      and internal architecture) and the software code that connects the two.
      Front-end development involves the creation or optimization of visible
      parts of websites or applications (the "client" end) that users view and
       interact with in their web browsers or on their mobile devices. These
       front-facing apps and websites are typically created using tools like
       HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
