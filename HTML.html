    <p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for
      documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted
      by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting
      languages such as JavaScript.Web browsers receive HTML documents from a
      web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia
       web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and
       originally included cues for the appearance of the document.HTML
       elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs,
       images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into
       the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents
       by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs,
        lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by
        tags, written using angle brackets.</p>
